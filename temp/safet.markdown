. Not really a project, but rather an explanation of "what is my perspective on tests". Here are screenshots of running a pre-commit hook on my latest RoR project, running tests, executing a rubocop (linter for ruby, yeah creator doesn't suck at naming...), screenshot of test coverage – I know only several examples of such coverage level (branch coverage, not just line coverage) in my companies and all of them were written with me as a lead. Also, a brakeman (vulnerability scanner) is integrated with a push hook as well as bundler-audit (tool to search CVEs in dependencies) – security is one of my passions ;) Cannot find a good screenshot of the mutation coverage pipeline I did for one of the previous projects on top of the mbj’s mutant, but I have a good article about that, which I presented on local company's meetup, series of which we arranged with a fiend (also did a task about property-based testing with ELM there). I wasn't joking in my resume’s achievements section, I really did lose 55 kg over two years (in case you are interested in “who is that person on video”).
