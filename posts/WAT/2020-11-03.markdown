title: Passwords complexity
language: english
---

I am a bit tired from such regular expressions to check password complexity.

```javascript
/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()])[A-z\d!@#$%^&*()]{8,18}$/
```

Several questions for the void:

- Why can't I use name of my favorite anime characters in the password?
- Why spaces are not allows, the longer â€“ the better, right?
- Size does matter, but why 18 is the limit? Your password may be shorted, but I want to go to the extreme!


P.S. If "we have that in the requirements" is the answer, such requirements are bad and must be a subject of change.
