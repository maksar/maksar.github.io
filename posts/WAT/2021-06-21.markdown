    thursday: 'Thursday',
    friday: 'Friday',
    saturday: 'Saturday',
    sunday: 'Sunday'
};

export function getDayOfTheWeekName(date) {
    switch (new Date(date).getDay()) {
        case 0:
            return daysOfTheWeekNames.sunday;
        case 1:
            return daysOfTheWeekNames.monday;
        case 2:
